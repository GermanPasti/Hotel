A hotel has a web application for its staff. The application allows the entry of data about the different rooms, as well as the creation of reservations. For the latter, in addition to saving guest data, payment data and data of the employee who charges the reservation, room availability according to the type and date chosen will be verified. If, for example, a double room is searched between the dates 02/12/2022 and 02/14/2022, the program will check both the availability of double rooms and those that are not reserved for the days specified in the query.

This would be the UML modeling for classes and their relationships.

Although it is an application for internal use, the graphical interface reflects the style of the hotel.

First, there is a sign-in page.

If the user does not have an account, the user can create one to access the system.

Now the user has accessed the system and we see a drop-down menu on the left and the user on the right.
